        <h2>Joan Blutter, FASID</h2>

        <p>As founder and president of Blutter/Shiff Designs, Joan Blutter was a leader in the interior design profession. </p> 
        <p>She had an impeccable reputation, and thanks to her gregarious personality and tireless work ethic, she received numerous awards and honors over the 50 years she was in business, including fellowship in the ASID and Designer of the Year numerous times. </p>
		<P>Joan played an intricate role in the creation of what today is known as the ASID: the American Society of Interior Designers. Throughout her career, she contributed her time and energy on behalf of the interior design industry, and was always actively involved in raising money for scholarships in design education. Her work has been published in both national and local trade publications, and she was featured numerous times on television and radio broadcasts. </p>
		<p>She enthusiastically lived every moment with a grand smile, and will also be fondly remembered as one who thoroughly loved people, and her warmth and generosity was truly "catching" to those who came into contact with her! </p>
		<p>Our firm is a product of her hard work and determination, as well as the fabulous sense of style and impeccable business practices she so strongly believed in. We are very proud to carry on the Joan Blutter tradition! </p>
